# Conway's Game of Life Project

This project uses an interactive GUI to mimic Conway's Game of Life. It also feaures an RLE translator, so if the user submits an RLE and hits enter, the field clears and the RLE is loaded into the field.

The "Play" button plays the next generation every second, showing which cells are alive and which aren't. The "Pause" button pauses the game, and the "Clear" button restarts it.
